Welcome to my website! I'm a software developer based in Murcia (Spain). Here you can find my latest articles about **software development**, tips and any other things related with webs, as well as have a look at my work.

If you are interested in my profile, you can check it out at **[Linkedin](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jgcarrilloweb)**. On the other hand, if you want to be a little more, you can go **[here]({% link about.md %})**.

**[Reading](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-hvx2dSsVgYn2t4nzhm93-SMDlxsCCbJdo7xiuFKLGY/edit?usp=sharing)** is one of my hobbies. Some of my favorite genres are history and personal growth books.
